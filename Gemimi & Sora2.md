# Ⅰ 猫猫🐱快乐周末

🪄A low-resolution digital photo taken on a Sony CCD-TRV. A group of cats hanging out in a mall food court. Harsh on-camera flash, slightly blown-out highlights, digital noise in the shadows. The skin texture looks slightly waxy due to early digital processing. Orange date stamp in the bottom right corner reading "{argument name="date stamp" default="04/12/2005"}". Candid, awkward angles, Myspace photo aesthetic.
