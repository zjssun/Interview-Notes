A tuxedo cat is repairing a black 1976 Chevrolet Impala, lying on its back on a mechanic's creeper under the car. Only the hind feet and the lower one-third of the body are visible protruding from underneath, and the face is hidden.**  *digital noise in the shadows. The skin texture looks slightly waxy due to early digital processing. Orange date stamp in the bottom right corner reading "{argument name="date stamp" default="06/06/1998"}". ==Candid, awkward angles, Myspace photo aesthetic, No humans allowed, vertical aspect ratio, 9:16.==*
